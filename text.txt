1.On orderProcess add the product include the product inside so that I can know the name of the 
Item assigned to the agent and be able to display it
 
2.On orderProcess make sure that the order is in the first place and then nested inside I 
Get to see the assigned items. For the moment I only the order process in terms of 
Assigned items .... Which means I can have like 12 assignments from one order while the
Order only has 2 items ... it should be that the order is in the first so that when 
I assign multiple time the number of assigned items can not be more that the items on the
Order 

It should {order:number,processStatus:string, orderItems(or assignedItems):array of order
Items assigned (including product names), order:order objects for getting details like 
Dates and location, customer:for getting the info the customer just in case }
